### 1. Description

A distributed system consists of several independent computers that communicate with each other over a network. Different distributed system architectures exist in the computer science. The most popular architecture is the Client-Server model. But especially in the parallel computing field, exist among others, Cluster Computing and Cloud Computing.

Cloud Computing implies scalable services and the consolidation of compute and storage resources in large-scale resource centers. This consolidation offers the opportunity to redistribute resources, which have been used so far to keep the own resources running. At the same time, the users of a Cloud infrastructure services have the freedom to use their desired operating systems, programming languages ​​and applications.

In this course, the fundamentals of Distributed System, Cloud Computing and related technologies are discussed. Practical exercises are an important part of this course because they are essential for thee understanding of these technologies.
