# THE REQUIREMENTS FOR PROJECTS

## Description:
Each group has to select one of freeware cloud services listed in the project list. Then, you deploy a multi-node cloud service with the selected software.
by using physical machines, virtual machines, containers, public cloud infrastructure services, etc. After successfully deploying, you deeply investigate which components your service has and analyze how these
components do interact with each other. At final step, you have to test your deployment with appropriate tools and create an installation guide, give a live demonstration during class
or during an exercise session.

## Project Specifics:

**Deliverables**: There are two components to this project, a report and
a demonstration.
1. Report:
No more than a 5-8 page report with proper screenshots and appropriate schematic
diagrams/flowcharts that describe all the steps you have explored and performed to install the systems.
The report should also contain the basic analysis and methodology about system components.
2. Demonstration: You only need to demonstrate the basic of systems working. The demonstration may be held
  in a lab or class. A sign-up sheet will be set
  up a few days prior to the submission date. If you finish the project
  sooner than the deadline, demonstration can be held prior to the
  deadline as well.
